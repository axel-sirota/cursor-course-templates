- Mock responses match OpenAPI schemas
- Docker services running
- Health check passing

**Estimated Time:** 60-90 minutes

**Dependencies:** None

## Phase 1: [HTTP Method] [Endpoint Path]

**Goal:** [One sentence description of what this endpoint does]

**Endpoint:** [METHOD] [PATH]

**Priority:** High/Medium/Low

**Deliverables:**
- Database migration for [table]
- Domain models ([Entity]Base, [Entity], [Entity]Create, [Entity]Update)
- [Entity]Repository with type-safe mappers
- [Entity]Service with business logic
- Real endpoint implementation
- E2E tests passing
- Phase summary document

**Success Criteria:**
- E2E test passes with real database
- Data persists correctly
- Proper error handling (400, 401, 404, 500)
- All code quality checks pass

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes

**Dependencies:** Phase 0

**Shared Libraries Created:**
- [Entity]Repository (available for reading in future phases)
- [Entity]Service (can be extended)
- [Entity] models (represent core entity)

---

## Phase 2: [HTTP Method] [Endpoint Path]

**Goal:** [One sentence description]

**Endpoint:** [METHOD] [PATH]

**Priority:** High/Medium/Low

**Deliverables:**
- [List if new tables needed, otherwise "Uses existing tables"]
- Additional repository methods (if needed)
- Service method implementation
- Real endpoint implementation
- E2E tests passing
- Phase summary document

**Success Criteria:**
- E2E test passes
- Integration with Phase 1 libraries works
- Error handling comprehensive

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 ([Entity]Repository available)

**Shared Libraries Created:**
- Extended [Entity]Repository with get_by_id()
- [Additional libraries if any]

---

## Phase 3: [HTTP Method] [Endpoint Path]

**Goal:** [One sentence description]

**Endpoint:** [METHOD] [PATH]

**Priority:** High/Medium/Low

**Deliverables:**
- Database migration for [new table]
- [NewEntity] models (layered)
- [NewEntity]Repository
- [NewEntity]Service
- Real endpoint implementation
- E2E tests passing
- Phase summary document

**Success Criteria:**
- New entity created successfully
- Foreign key relationships work
- E2E tests pass

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes

**Dependencies:** Phase 1, Phase 2

**Shared Libraries Created:**
- [NewEntity]Repository
- [NewEntity]Service
- [NewEntity] models

## Phase Priority Matrix

### Must Have (Phase 0-3)
Critical functionality required for MVP:
- Phase 0: Skeleton
- Phase 1: [Core creation endpoint]
- Phase 2: [Core read endpoint]
- Phase 3: [Core related entity]

### Should Have (Phase 4-6)
Important but not blocking:
- Phase 4: [Update endpoint]
- Phase 5: [List endpoint]
- Phase 6: [Delete endpoint]

### Nice to Have (Phase 7+)
Enhancement features:
- Phase 7: [Advanced feature]
- Phase 8: [Analytics/reporting]
- Phase 9: [Additional integrations]

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1
- Phase 0: Skeleton (Day 1)
- Phase 1-2: Core functionality (Day 2-3)
- Phase 3-4: Extended functionality (Day 4-5)

### Week 2
- Phase 5-6: Complete CRUD (Day 1-2)
- Phase 7+: Enhancements (Day 3-5)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Phases
- [Phase N]: [Reason - complexity, external dependencies, etc.]

### Dependencies Between Phases
```
Phase 1 (Create) → Phase 2 (Read) → Phase 3 (Related Entity)
                ↓
              Phase 4 (Update)
                ↓
              Phase 5 (Delete)
```

### Blocking Issues
- Database schema changes require careful migration planning
- Authentication must work in Phase 0 before implementing protected endpoints
- Foreign key relationships need parent tables to exist first

## Testing Strategy

### Per Phase
- E2E test written before implementation
- E2E test must fail initially
- Implementation makes test pass
- Unit tests added for complex business logic

### Integration Testing
After Phase 3: Test cross-entity operations
After Phase 6: Complete CRUD testing
After Phase 9: Full system integration tests

## Quality Gates

### Before Completing Each Phase
- [ ] All E2E tests passing
- [ ] Code formatted (Black)
- [ ] Type checking passing (mypy)
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Phase summary generated
- [ ] Changes committed

### Before Moving to Production
- [ ] All phases complete
- [ ] Full test suite passing
- [ ] Security review complete
- [ ] Performance testing done
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Rollback Plan

### If Phase Fails
1. Revert to previous phase summary state
2. Review what went wrong
3. Adjust approach or split into smaller phases
4. Restart phase with new strategy

### Database Rollback
Each migration should be reversible:
- Keep old migration files
- Test rollback procedures
- Document migration dependencies
