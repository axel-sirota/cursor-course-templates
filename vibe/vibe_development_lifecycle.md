# Development Lifecycle Guide

## Purpose

This guide provides instructions for the Cursor LLM on how to manage the Git workflow and development lifecycle for Python/FastAPI projects. Use this as a reference when the user requests Git operations.

## Git Workflow Commands

### Start New Feature
**User says:** "Start new feature: [feature-name]"
**You do:** 
```bash
cd your_project
make start-feature FEATURE_NAME=[feature-name]
```

**What this does:**
- Switches to develop branch
- Pulls latest develop
- Creates feature branch: `feature/[feature-name]`
- Pushes feature branch to remote
- Validates feature name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only)

### Push Feature
**User says:** "Push feature" or "Merge [feature-name]"
**You do:**
```bash
cd your_project
make push-feature
```

**What this does:**
- Checks you're on a feature branch
- Pulls latest develop and rebases
- Runs quality checks (`make quality`)
- Pushes feature branch to remote
- Creates PR from feature â†’ develop
- Uses GitHub CLI if available, otherwise provides manual instructions

### Complete Feature
**User says:** "Complete feature" or "Finish feature" (after PR is merged)
**You do:**
```bash
cd your_project
make complete-feature
```

**What this does:**
- Checks you're on a feature branch
- Verifies PR has been merged
- Switches to develop branch
- Pulls latest develop
- Deletes local feature branch
- Deletes remote feature branch
- Runs final quality check on develop
- Provides next steps guidance

**PR Description Format:**
- **Title**: "Feature: [Feature Name]"
- **Summary**: Brief description of what the feature does
- **Key Changes**: Bullet list of main changes from recent commits

### Release to Production
**User says:** "Release to production" or "Deploy to production"
**You do:**
```bash
cd your_project
make deploy-production
```

**What this does:**
- Ensures you're on develop branch
- Pulls latest develop
- Runs quality checks
- Generates changelog from commit messages
- Updates version in pyproject.toml
- Pushes develop with release updates
- Creates PR from develop â†’ main
- Provides release checklist and next steps

**PR Description Format:**
- **Title**: "ðŸš€ Production Release v[version]"
- **Summary**: Brief description of the release
- **Key Changes**: Bullet list of main changes from recent commits

## Project Structure

### Overview
This guide assumes a standard Python/FastAPI project structure with proper Git workflow management.

### Repository Structure
- **Main Repository**: Your project repository
- **Development Branch**: `develop` (main development branch)
- **Production Branch**: `main` (production releases)
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/[feature-name]` (feature development)

## Branch Strategy

- **develop**: Main development branch (always deploy from here)
- **feature/[name]**: Feature branches (created from develop)
- **main**: Production branch (only updated via PR from develop)

## Quality Gates

All commands automatically run:
- `make quality` (ruff, black, mypy, pytest)
- Rebase on latest develop
- Commit message validation
- Feature branch naming validation

## Commit Message Conventions

The changelog generator looks for these prefixes:
- `feat:` or `feature:` - New features
- `fix:` or `bugfix:` - Bug fixes
- `change:` or `update:` - Changes/updates
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `security:` or `sec:` - Security updates
- `docs:` or `doc:` - Documentation updates

## File Structure

```
your_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ start-feature.sh      # Feature branch creation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ push-feature.sh       # Feature push and PR creation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deploy-production.sh  # Production release
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ generate-changelog.sh # Changelog generation
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pull_request_template.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile                  # Enhanced with Git workflow commands
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml           # Version management and tool configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements-dev.txt     # Development dependencies
â””â”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md             # Generated changelog
```

## Common User Requests

### "Start new feature: user authentication"
```bash
cd your_project
make start-feature FEATURE_NAME=user-authentication
```

### "Push feature"
```bash
cd your_project
make push-feature
```

### "Complete feature"
```bash
cd your_project
make complete-feature
```

### "Release to production"
```bash
cd your_project
make deploy-production
```

### "Merge user authentication"
```bash
cd your_project
make push-feature
```

### "Complete user authentication"
```bash
cd your_project
make complete-feature
```

## Error Handling

If any command fails:
1. **Quality checks fail**: Tell user to fix issues and try again
2. **Rebase conflicts**: Tell user to resolve conflicts and continue
3. **Not on correct branch**: Tell user to switch to appropriate branch
4. **Uncommitted changes**: Tell user to commit or stash changes first

## Prerequisites

- User must be in the project root directory
- Git repository must be initialized
- Remote origin must be configured
- GitHub CLI (gh) is optional but recommended for automatic PR creation

## Notes for Future Self

- Always run commands from the project root directory
- The scripts are already executable and ready to use
- Quality gates ensure code quality before any Git operations
- Changelog generation is automatic and follows conventional commit format
- **PR descriptions are automatically generated** - no need for user to edit templates
- **Create concise PR descriptions** with Summary + Key Changes format
- Version management is handled automatically in pyproject.toml

## PR Description Guidelines

When creating PRs, always generate concise descriptions:

**For Feature PRs:**
```
## Summary
Implements [feature name] - [brief description].

## Key Changes
- [Change 1 from commit message]
- [Change 2 from commit message]
- [Change 3 from commit message]
```

**For Production Releases:**
```
## Summary
Production release v[version] - merges latest changes from develop to main.

## Key Changes
- [Recent change 1]
- [Recent change 2]
- [Recent change 3]

**Version:** v[version]
**Release Date:** [date]
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied" errors:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

**"Not in git repository" errors:**
```bash
cd your_project
```

**"GitHub CLI not found" warnings:**
- Install GitHub CLI or create PRs manually using provided URLs

**"Quality checks failed" errors:**
- Run `make quality` manually to see specific issues
- Fix issues and try again

## Development Workflow

### Important Notes
- **Single repository** workflow for Python/FastAPI projects
- **PRs are created** for each feature
- **PRs must be merged** for complete feature completion
- **Production releases** require proper testing and validation

### Workflow Summary
1. **Start Feature** â†’ Branch created from develop
2. **Push Feature** â†’ PR created from feature â†’ develop
3. **Merge PR** â†’ Repository updated
4. **Complete Feature** â†’ Branch cleaned up
5. **Deploy Production** â†’ Production PR from develop â†’ main

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
**"Working tree not clean" errors:**
- Ensure all changes are committed or stashed before running commands
- Check git status for uncommitted changes

**"Branch not found" errors:**
- Verify you're on the correct branch
- Check that the feature branch exists locally and remotely
